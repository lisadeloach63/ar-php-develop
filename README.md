### Arabic Language
Worldwide Internet use has grown tremendously in recent years, most rapidly in non-English speaking regions especially in Arab world. For example, from 2000 to 2019, the online populations grew by more than 8,900 %. Meanwhile, Arabic Web content was estimated to be doubling every year. Such growth has created demand for better websites developing resources in Arabic language. However, existing websites developing resources may be unable to meet it because they primarily serve English-speaking users.

The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter can be linked to (in the case of a library, 'used by') a non-(L)GPLed program, which may be free software or proprietary software. This non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any chosen terms if it is not a derivative work.
