### Mission & Vision

Our mission is to develop open source solutions and provides professional support helps small and medium size companies meet the challenges of developing professional Arabic websites in the PHP/MySQL environment, the library that we develop helps our partners in save time and increase productivity.

This project provides a set of tools that enable Arabic website developers to serve professional search, present and process Arabic content in PHP.

### Arabic Language
Worldwide Internet use has grown tremendously in recent years, most rapidly in non-English speaking regions especially in Arab world. For example, from 2000 to 2019, the online populations grew by more than 8,900 %. Meanwhile, Arabic Web content was estimated to be doubling every year. Such growth has created demand for better websites developing resources in Arabic language. However, existing websites developing resources may be unable to meet it because they primarily serve English-speaking users.
